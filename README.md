# Getting Started with Video Link Storage Frontend

This project is the frontend for **Video Link Storage**, built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is optimized for performance and ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need full control over the configuration files (e.g., webpack, Babel), you can run `npm run eject`. Use this carefully, as it makes future updates harder.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React structure:

- **`src/pages`**: Contains all page components like `Home`, `Login`, `Register`, etc.
- **`src/components`**: Reusable components such as `Navbar` and `Footer`.
- **`src/styles`**: Contains CSS files for styling individual components and pages.
- **`public`**: Static assets like the app logo and favicon.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: A dynamic gradient background with Font Awesome icons for visual enhancement.
- **Video Grid**: Displays videos fetched from the backend API with search functionality for logged-in users.
- **Authentication**: User login and registration functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly for various screen sizes.
